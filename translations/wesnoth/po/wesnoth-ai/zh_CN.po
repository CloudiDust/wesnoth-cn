"<u>General</u>: These AIs are set up to simulate (to some extent) how these "
"animals behave in real life. This includes that they are animals, meaning "
"that they are not super smart. As an example, the wolves generally hunt in a "
"pack, but are easily distracted by prey coming into range. They are also "
"decent, but not great at cornering deer. For the most part, this is "
"intentional.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Bears (replaced by Ghasts), Spiders and Yetis</u> mostly just wander in "
"their respective parts of the map. They stay out of each other's way (and "
"out of the way of the dogs), but do attack each other if cornered. They "
"attack the other, weaker animals (deer etc.) if those are within range.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Wolves</u> hunt in a pack. They actively go after the closest deer (as "
"long as it stays in the forest) and try to corner it (not always super "

"The wolves try to avoid getting into the range of bears, spiders, dogs and "
"the yeti, except when they are going in for an attack. If you let them move "
"for long enough, they will also learn that it is not healthy to attack the "

"<u>Sheep dogs (replaced by Footpads)</u> try to keep their sheep safe. This "

"might have to let the scenario play for quite some time before you get to "
"see an interesting dog/wolf interaction. If no active herding or protecting "
