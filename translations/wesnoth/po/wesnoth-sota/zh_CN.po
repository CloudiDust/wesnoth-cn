"My experiments with bats have proven unfruitful. I have determined that they "

"Today, headmaster Aimucasur himself taught a class on moving objects with "

"and then learning to move it as an extension of the body. Incantations focus "
"the mind to the task. We practiced with inanimate objects, but clearly the "
"same principle could be applied to unliving flesh. Nobody dared voice the "
"thought, because showing interest in the necromantic arts results in "

"One of my bats must have been old, for it died. Boldly then, I decided to "
"animate the corpse. I was pleased to see that it worked, but what was "
"interesting was this: The first time the bat twitched, I felt a last spark "
"of life energy flash through its body. I noted that it flowed through some "
"kind of pathway. That gave me an idea. With my mind, I searched out all the "
"life force pathways in its body using what I could sense in the living bats "
"as a guide. Then I animated <i>them</i> all at once, and the bat slowly "
"flapped off the floor on its own! (That is a trick old Aimucasur probably "
"doesn’t know!) Even better, the energy running through the life force "
"network seemed to maintain itself, so I didn’t need to continue to "
"concentrate. Could this be the whole secret? Could all the ancient lords "

"量似乎能够自给自足，所以我不必继续全神贯注。这会不会就是亡灵巫术的全部秘密？"

"With further observation, I have determined that this is probably not the "

"soon I will have the opportunity to find out... because I’m quitting the "
"Academy. I will be in my room when old Morvihn checks for the night, but not "
"two hours later! I grow weary of this place and its restrictions on thought. "
"So, no more brown initiate’s robes, no more being ridiculed on account of my "

"We prevailed today on the field, but our victory was somewhat bitter. "
"<i>Everyone</i> was afraid or angry and immediately attacked us instead of "
"listening to our news. I realize now... the world is not ready for our "
"knowledge. They cannot understand that we have conquered that primordial "
"fear: death. Instead, as they look upon us, judgment of our appearance "
"drives them to ignorant terror. I give up on all of them. For now, I shall "
"just withdraw — perhaps live in the old troll city and learn the "
"applications of mountain fire. In some future time, less conservative "
"attitudes may dominate, and our knowledge can be put to good use. I can "
"certainly afford to wait. In the meantime, we are doing what we can to "
