"It’s unfair that we humans must die after so few years. Elves and dwarves "
"live far longer. Though this may be the natural order, we need not embrace "
"it! The lords on the Green Isle knew how to live forever. Pursuit of that "
"knowledge was declared illegal by King Haldric I, but I believe it is worth "
"the risk. As I watched my family waste away of various maladies, I vowed "
"that I would not share their fate, and if I can rediscover the secrets of "
"the ancients I will be a hero to the whole continent! I shall begin research "

"My experiments with bats have proven unfruitful. I have determined that they "
"do not truly drain the life force of their victims — it is an illusion. The "
"loss of blood weakens the victim, while the bat gains vitality because it "
"has fed. There is nothing I can learn from bats about extending life. Now I "
"have a problem. I am forced to keep the bats and pretend they are my pets "
"because I cannot admit why I was studying them. In truth, it is not a burden "

"Today, headmaster Aimucasur himself taught a class on moving objects with "
"one’s mind. The technique involves projecting one’s will inside the item, "
"and then learning to move it as an extension of the body. Incantations focus "
"the mind to the task. We practiced with inanimate objects, but clearly the "
"same principle could be applied to unliving flesh. Nobody dared voice the "
"thought, because showing interest in the necromantic arts results in "
"expulsion. I was pondering that fact in class when I noticed Aimucasur "
"glowering at me. I must be more careful in the future about which of my "
"thoughts appear on my face."

"One of my bats must have been old, for it died. Boldly then, I decided to "
"animate the corpse. I was pleased to see that it worked, but what was "
"interesting was this: The first time the bat twitched, I felt a last spark "
"of life energy flash through its body. I noted that it flowed through some "
"kind of pathway. That gave me an idea. With my mind, I searched out all the "
"life force pathways in its body using what I could sense in the living bats "
"as a guide. Then I animated <i>them</i> all at once, and the bat slowly "
"flapped off the floor on its own! (That is a trick old Aimucasur probably "
"doesn’t know!) Even better, the energy running through the life force "
"network seemed to maintain itself, so I didn’t need to continue to "
"concentrate. Could this be the whole secret? Could all the ancient lords "
"have had someone bring them back <i>after</i> death? I would need another "
"mage I trusted completely, but perhaps I can find someone with whom to make "
"a pact."

"With further observation, I have determined that this is probably not be the "
"way death is avoided. The reanimated bat has no will! It does nothing unless "
"I nudge it with my mind. Perhaps the will of a human is stronger, and "
"someday soon I will have the opportunity to find out... because I’m quitting "
"the Academy. I will be in my room when old Morvihn checks for the night, but "
"not two hours later! I grow weary of this place and its restrictions on "
"thought. So, no more brown initiate’s robes, no more being ridiculed on "
"account of my hair, no more pompous instructors. I will teach myself the so-"
"called “dark” arts and learn how to live forever! The ancients from the "
"Green Isle found a way, so I can discover it too. When all these oldsters "
"here find themselves breathing their last, they will have to beg me for the "
"secret. Perhaps I will be generous. Perhaps not."
