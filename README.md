Wesnoth Simplified Chinese Translation Project Readme
-----------------------------------------------------

# Introduction

This is a project dedicated to the Simplified Chinese translations of the open source turn-based strategy game, [the Battle for Wesnoth](http://wesnoth.org). First released in 2003, Wesnoth is one of the most polished open source games ever made.

Wesnoth uses GNU Gettext to support multiple languages, and the official policy of translation submission is to send the translated files manually to the game's translation manager.

When this translation project started back in 2009/2010 on Google Code, the game was hosted in an SVN repository which was not exactly fork-friendly compared to Git. So a decision was made to maintain the translation files out of the official source tree in a [Mercurial repository](https://code.google.com/p/wesnoth-translation-cn).

Nowadays the game is [hosted on Github](https://https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth), while the translation submission policy remain unchanged. Thus this project is also [moved to Github](https://https://github.com/CloudiDust/wesnoth-cn) but still out-of-the-tree. (Note however this repository is restarted from sketch, see the original Mercurial repository for the history.)

# How to Participate

Anyone willing to translate the game into Simplified Chinese are welcome.

Most of the translation-related discussions are happening in the QQ Group 131160118. Players can have discussions about the game in the Wesnoth [Tieba](http://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E9%9F%A6%E8%AF%BA%E4%B9%8B%E6%88%98&ie=utf-8).

When you finish some translations, please file a pull request, post the resulting po files in the QQ group, or send them to my mailbox (cloudidust at gmail), and I will take care of the rest.

The translation progress and assignments are tracked in [Issue #1](https://github.com/CloudiDust/wesnoth-cn/issues/1).

# Special Thanks
