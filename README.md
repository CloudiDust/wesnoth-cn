Wesnoth Simplified Chinese Localization Project
-----------------------------------------------

# Introduction

This is a project dedicated to the Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) localization of the open source turn-based strategy game, [the Battle for Wesnoth](https://wesnoth.org).

First released in 2003, Wesnoth is one of the most polished open source games ever made. The game uses GNU Gettext to support localized text, and native support for image (game map) localization is also present. In compliance with official localization management policy, this project maintains translated assets out of the official source tree.

# How to Participate

Anyone willing to help with the Simplified Chinese localization is welcome.

Most of the localization-related discussions are happening in the QQ Group 131160118. Chinese players usually have discussions about the game in the Wesnoth [Tieba](http://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E9%9F%A6%E8%AF%BA%E4%B9%8B%E6%88%98&ie=utf-8).

When you are ready to submit some localized assets, please file a pull request, post the resulting files in the QQ group, or send them to my mailbox (cloudidust at gmail), and I will take care of the rest.

# Note: Project Origin

Back in 2010 the work on Wesnoth's zh_CN localization was kind of in a hiatus and not quite coordinated, so I (Cloudidust), with the permission of then zh_CN translation maintainer *sylecn*, started this project and hosted it on Google Code, in a [Mercurial repository](https://code.google.com/p/wesnoth-translation-cn). In 2015 this project was moved to [Github](https://https://github.com/CloudiDust/wesnoth-cn), but I made a mistake: starting a new git repo instead of importing the hg one. I regret it, but if interested you can browse/download the hg repo archive for history.
